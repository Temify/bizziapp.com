# Welcome to new Mintlight project

To start developing, clone this repo and create a new branch, like `dev-denis`.

Keep a Pull Request open with all the current staged changes. Once you are ready for a mid-time review, ask Denis for review and he will close and merge your PR but will leave the branch open on origin. Feel free to continue and open new PR, so your current changes are visible.

:) Enjoy working on it! ðŸŽ‰
